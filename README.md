# Odin-Recipes
Testing, testing, is this thing on?

In this project I practiced my ability to create a new repo, clone it onto my local machine, open the directory, and create/edit a README files.

I also practiced navigating the terminal as I created files & directories. I also practiced committing frequently while writing informative git commit messages.

By the end of the project I have created a functioning recipe website that specifically hosts three off my most popular fried dishes that I make for friends and family.
